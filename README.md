# xbazel
xbazel is inspired by xmake & bazel, the target is to mantain an large number of open-source C++ library bazel BUILD files that you can simply find and import into your project.
### There are 3 kind of files:
1. Lots of bazel BUILD file for those great C++ libraries in github
2. A bazel script(xbazel.bzl) that can easily import these c++ libraries to your project
3. A simple cpp server demo(main.cc) that uses these libraries.


### Issues is welcome, including new library proposals

### For all libraries usage information, please refer to the WORKSPACE file.

### Thease libraries are all open source libraries from github, let's thanks for their great job!
