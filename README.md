xbazel is inspired by xmake & bazel, the target is to mantain an large number of open-source C++ library bazel BUILD files that you can simply find and import into your project.
There are 3 kind of files:
1.Lots of bazel BUILD file collections for those great C++ libraries in github
2.A bazel script that can easily import this c++ libraries to your project
3.A simple cpp server demo that uses this libraries.


Every problems is welcome, including new library
